# movies

This is a **toy project** that uses a custom NLP to give you movie reccommendations from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). Built with [React.js](https://react.dev) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

It was originally developed to learn react and spring boot with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PdEmeopJVQ) from [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org), but later on I decided to upgrade the project so I added more features and deployed it.
